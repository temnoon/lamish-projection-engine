# Lamish Projection Engine - Project Update

## Overview
The Lamish Projection Engine (LPE) is a "Post-social" network concept that uses allegorical discourse to transform real-world narratives into fictional contexts while preserving their meaning and structure.

## Latest Improvements (July 12, 2025)

### 1. Fixed Meaningful Narrative Transformations
**Problem**: The projection system was generating generic content instead of preserving the actual narrative structure.

**Solution**: 
- Updated LLM prompts to emphasize direct mapping of story elements
- Enhanced MockLLMProvider to generate context-aware transformations
- Removed old MockLLMTransformer in favor of proper LLMTransformer

**Result**: Projections now successfully transform narratives like:
- "Sam Altman dropped out of Stanford..." → "Navigator-Innovator Keth-9 departed the Academy of Harmonic Sciences..."
- All key elements (characters, actions, outcomes) are preserved in the new context

### 2. Maieutic Dialogue Integration
The Socratic questioning system now:
- Extracts deeper insights through progressive questioning
- Suggests appropriate projection configurations based on dialogue
- Creates enriched narratives that incorporate discovered elements
- Seamlessly flows into the projection system

### 3. Environment Configuration
- All LLM models configurable via environment variables
- No hardcoded model names (uses LPE_LLM_MODEL, LPE_EMBEDDING_MODEL)
- Supports both Ollama (gemma3:12b) and mock providers

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Translation Chain**: 5-step transformation process
   - Deconstruct: Extract narrative elements
   - Map: Convert to target namespace
   - Reconstruct: Rebuild story in new context
   - Stylize: Apply language style
   - Reflect: Generate meta-commentary

2. **Maieutic Dialogue**: Socratic questioning to explore narratives
   - Progressive depth levels (0-4)
   - Automatic insight extraction
   - Configuration suggestions based on content

3. **Storage**: PostgreSQL with pgvector
   - 768-dimensional embeddings for semantic search
   - Complete projection history
   - Namespace and persona management

### Example Transformation
```
Original: Tech entrepreneur leaves university → starts companies → leads AI org
Projected: Navigator leaves Academy → creates ventures → leads consciousness revolution
```

## Current Status
✅ Core projection system - Complete and functional
✅ Maieutic dialogue - Fully integrated
✅ LLM integration - Flexible provider system
✅ Database schema - Ready with pgvector
✅ CLI interface - Rich terminal UI
✅ Meaningful transformations - Fixed and verified

## Usage
```bash
# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run projection
python -m lamish_projection_engine project

# Run maieutic dialogue
python -m lamish_projection_engine maieutic

# Full demo
python demo_full_flow.py
```

## Key Innovation
The system successfully creates allegorical projections that:
- Preserve narrative meaning and structure
- Transform contexts while maintaining relationships
- Enable indirect discourse about sensitive topics
- Create a "post-social" communication layer

The Lamish Projection Engine is now a functional prototype demonstrating how AI can mediate meaningful narrative transformations for allegorical communication.
